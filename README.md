TDD
=============

This repo contains the resulting code from Workshops on TDD held at different occasions.
When known katas are used the testfile should contain a link to the kata in question.

It is also a good starting point to begin a new kata, with dependencies included for
- JUnit
- AssertJ
- Mockito
- Guava

# Installation
Uses maven for dependency management. After cloning, import into eclipse using Import...->Existing Maven Project. Do similar for IntelliJ or your favourite IDE.

# Suggested escalation

## 1. TDD a simple class without dependencies
<http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1>

## 2. TDD a class using Mockito to mock a dependency 
<http://www.slideshare.net/Jonananas/mockito-kata></br>
** The instructions here need some more detail if you are a beginner **
 
## 3. TDD the database 
Goto <https://github.com/jonananas/tdd-the-database> and follow the instructions. 

# TODO
* Merge java8 branch into master, making master a java6 branch
* Provide more detailed instructions for the Mockito kata
* Add instructions for Factor and Builder kata.
* Possibly add TDD-instructions or video for beginners.
